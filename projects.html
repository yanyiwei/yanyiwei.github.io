                In this project, we seek to develop a system that helps user to quickly create functional prototypes with complex interactive behaviors. I worked on features that would faciliate the creation of complex animations. e.g. I designed and developed an "animation path editing" feature that enables users to visualize the motion of elements
                as a line, and modify the animation by editing the length, direction, and/or position of the line.

              This project aims to assist user program faster and more efficiently by connecting them with an online helper. I developed a simple and intuitive UI to enable a more friendly user experience in user studies, allowing users to visualize information and
              familiarize with the system more quickly.
